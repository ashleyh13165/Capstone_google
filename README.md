This is my Google Capstone Project for the Google Analytics course. 
I chose to do the Cyclistic case study.
I will be using the ROCCC method to get the answers to the questions asked.
The questions that need to be answered are:
>How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
>Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
>How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
Reliable - yes, the data I have is not bias
Original - yes, I can got the data from the compny 
Comprehensive - yes, there is no impotrant data missing from this for the project
Current - yes, the data is updated on a monthly basis
Cited - yes, the data came from teh company
I will be using the public dataset located at https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement.
The buisness task I am trying to accomplish here is to find the different ways the Member and Casual riders use the bike sharing and find a way to convert casual riders to members.
The first step I needed to take was downloading the data and storing it. I download January 2021 to december 2021 and put it in a folder named Trip Data.
I used RStudio on the desktop to clean my data because some months were to big to upload to google sheets and I prefer teh data cleaning tools along with the visuals teh program offers.
I have included all teh steps I took on R to clean and analys the data in my .
